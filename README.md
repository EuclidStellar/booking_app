# Concurrent Booking App in Golang

## Overview

This Golang-based Booking app demonstrates the concept of concurrency. It allows users to book various services concurrently,
 showcasing the power and efficiency of Go's concurrency features.

## Features

- **Concurrent Booking:**
  - Users can book services concurrently without blocking operations.

- **Service Options:**
  - The app provides various services that users can book simultaneously.

## How It Works

The app utilizes Golang's goroutines and channels to achieve concurrency.
Each booking request is processed concurrently, allowing for efficient handling of
multiple requests simultaneously.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have Golang installed. If not,
follow the instructions on the [Golang website](https://golang.org/doc/install).
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EuclidStellar/booking_app/
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd booking_app
   ```

3. Run the app:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

## Usage

1. Access the app through your preferred web browser.
2. Explore the available services.
3. Simultaneously book multiple services to observe concurrent processing.

## Concurrency in Golang

The app's source code is structured to highlight Golang's concurrency features, including goroutines and channels. Refer to the source code for an in-depth understanding of how concurrency is implemented.
